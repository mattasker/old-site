I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds. Here, I am studying the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in populations of bacteria, and hope to unveil a deeper understanding of how fluctuations can impact the outcomes of such systems. These findings are relevant to the global issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and so could have implications for the clinical use of antimicrobials.

I undertook my graduate studies at the University of Manchester in Theoretical Physics, which leaves me now feeling like a physicist disguised as a mathematician. 

My main research interests are in mathematical biology, complex systems, and statistical physics.

Here you will find everything to do with my publications, talks, teaching, and anything else I think is worthwhile having on here!

If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so on my email: mmmwa@leeds.ac.uk.
