I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds. I undertook my undergraduate studies at the University of Manchester in Theoretical Physics, which leaves me now feeling like a physicist disguised as a mathematician. 

My main research interests are in mathematical biology, complex systems, and statistical physics. Check out my research page for more details.

Here you will find everything to do with my publications, talks, teaching, and anything else I think is worthwhile having on here.

If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so on my email: mmmwa@leeds.ac.uk.

I also maintain the website for the research group I am currently part of, which can be found here: [eedfp.com](https://eedfp.com).
