I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds. I undertook my undergraduate studies at the University of Manchester in Theoretical Physics, which leaves me now feeling like a physicist disguised as a mathematician. 

My research focuses on utilising techniques from non-equilibrium statistical physics to investigate problems concerning the evolutionary dynamics of biological systems.
Check out my [research page](https://mattasker.github.io/research/) for more details.

Here you will find everything to do with my publications, talks, teaching, and anything else I think is worthwhile having on here.

If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so on my email: mmmwa@leeds.ac.uk.

You can find me on Twitter: [@askermatthew](https://twitter.com/askermatthew)

I maintain the website for the Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Fluctuating Populations research group that I am part of, which can be found here: [eedfp.com](https://eedfp.com).

Check out the L24EEDs workshop that I am co-organising (Leeds, 9th-12th July 2024): [eedfp.com](https://eedfp.com/l24eeds-workshop)
