This talk was a part of the School of Mathematics internal PGR Seminar, where all postgraduate researchers have the opportunity to present their research to the department. I presented the results of [this paper](https://mattasker.github.io/publication/2023-07-14-coexistence).

I won the award for 'Best Presentation in Applied Mathematics', and with the prize money bought myself the book "In a Flight of Starlings". It's short, but a nice read!
